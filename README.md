Random javascript-centric projects


###Berry Challenge
Was gonna be a genetic algorithm-driven evolution simulator but the deadline came and went before I got to it, still hoping to get it done


###Game Engine 
Basically just taming tile rendering and stuff, the hope's to end up with something I'll be able to use to make dungeon-crawlers, galaga clones, etc. with.
